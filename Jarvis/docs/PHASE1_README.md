# Jarvis MCP - Phase 1: Discoverability Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the first phase implementation of the Jarvis Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, focusing on **Discoverability** tools that enable users to explore and understand the Jarvis ecosystem.

## Design Philosophy

Following MCP best practices from the comprehensive design document, this implementation uses a **workflow-first approach** rather than direct API mapping. The tools are designed to solve complete user problems and provide intelligent, contextual assistance for HPC workflow planning.

## Phase 1: Discoverability Tools

The discoverability phase provides five core tools that enable users to explore and understand the Jarvis ecosystem:

### üîç Core Tools

#### 1. `get_all_packages`
**Purpose**: Retrieve comprehensive catalog of all available packages in the Jarvis ecosystem.

**Key Features**:
- Scans all registered repositories in priority order
- Categorizes packages by type (service, application, interceptor)
- Provides relevance scoring based on usage patterns
- Identifies package relationships and common combinations
- Generates quick-start recommendations

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Get all packages
catalog = await get_all_packages()

# Filter by type
applications = await get_all_packages(package_type="application")

# Sort by popularity
popular = await get_all_packages(sort_by="popularity")
```

#### 2. `get_package_info`
**Purpose**: Retrieve detailed information about specific packages with intelligent filtering.

**Key Features**:
- Smart content filtering based on user intent
- Configuration parameter extraction with detailed explanations
- Output specifications and usage examples
- Performance characteristics and optimization guidance
- Related package suggestions

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Basic package info
info = await get_package_info("incompact3d")

# Configuration-focused query
config_info = await get_package_info(
    "incompact3d", 
    return_config_params=True,
    return_examples=True
)

# Output-focused query
output_info = await get_package_info(
    "incompact3d",
    return_outputs=True,
    return_performance_notes=True
)
```

#### 3. `get_all_repos`
**Purpose**: List all registered repositories with comprehensive status information.

**Key Features**:
- Repository priority system explanation
- Health status indicators (active, warning, error)
- Package inventory with counts and featured packages
- Repository types (builtin, custom, development)

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Full repository status
repos = await get_all_repos()

# Basic repository list
simple_repos = await get_all_repos(
    include_package_counts=False,
    include_health_status=False
)
```

#### 4. `modify_repo`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive repository lifecycle management with safety controls.

**Key Features**:
- ADD: Register new repositories with validation
- DELETE: Safely remove repositories with impact analysis
- PROMOTE: Elevate repository priority with conflict resolution
- Safety features: structure validation, dependency analysis, rollback support

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Add new repository
result = await modify_repo(
    repo_name="myorg_tools",
    operation="add",
    repo_path="/path/to/myorg_tools"
)

# Promote repository to highest priority
result = await modify_repo(
    repo_name="myorg_tools",
    operation="promote"
)

# Remove repository
result = await modify_repo(
    repo_name="old_repo",
    operation="delete"
)
```

#### 5. `get_resource_status`
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive cluster resource information for deployment planning.

**Key Features**:
- Hardware inventory with deployment-relevant specifications
- Network topology with bandwidth and latency characteristics
- Storage hierarchy with performance and capacity details
- Deployment recommendations based on resource constraints
- Optimization opportunities identification

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Complete resource status
resources = await get_resource_status()

# Hardware-focused analysis
hardware = await get_resource_status(
    include_network=False,
    include_storage=False,
    detail_level="comprehensive"
)
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Tools

Essential Jarvis Manager configuration tools for Phase 1:

#### `jm_create_config`
Initialize Jarvis configuration directories.

#### `jm_load_config`
Load existing Jarvis configuration.

#### `jm_set_hostfile`
Configure hostfile for multi-node deployments.

#### `jm_graph_build`
Build resource graph for deployment planning.

## Architecture

### Data Models

All tools use Pydantic models for type-safe, structured responses:

- **PackageCatalog**: Comprehensive package listings with metadata
- **PackageInformation**: Detailed package information with filtering
- **RepositoryStatus**: Repository health and configuration data
- **RepositoryOperationResult**: Repository management operation results
- **ClusterResourceStatus**: Resource information for deployment planning

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with specific guidance:

```python
class DiscoverabilityError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for discoverability-related errors"""
    pass

def handle_mcp_errors(func):
    """Decorator to handle errors and convert to appropriate MCP responses"""
    # Provides specific guidance based on error type
    # Converts Jarvis errors to MCP-compatible responses
```

### Optional Dependencies

The implementation gracefully handles missing Jarvis components:

```python
# Jarvis components are optional dependencies
try:
    from jarvis_cd.basic.jarvis_manager import JarvisManager
    JARVIS_MANAGER_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    JARVIS_MANAGER_AVAILABLE = False
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** with pip
2. **Pydantic 2.0+** for data models
3. **FastMCP** for MCP server implementation
4. **Jarvis-CD** (optional, for full functionality)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Jarvis-CD (optional):
```bash
pip install jarvis-cd
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Run with stdio transport (default)
python -m jarvis_mcp.server

# Run with SSE transport
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse python -m jarvis_mcp.server

# Run with custom host/port
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse MCP_SSE_HOST=localhost MCP_SSE_PORT=8080 python -m jarvis_mcp.server
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_phase1.py
```

The test suite verifies:
- ‚úÖ Model imports and functionality
- ‚úÖ Discoverability function availability
- ‚úÖ Server structure and tool registration
- ‚úÖ Pydantic model serialization

## User Query Patterns

Phase 1 tools are designed to handle these common user queries:

### Discovery Queries
- "What packages are available?"
- "What can I deploy with Jarvis?"
- "Show me all storage-related packages"
- "What are the most popular packages?"

### Package Information Queries
- "What is the Incompact3D package?"
- "What outputs does Incompact3D generate?"
- "How do I configure Incompact3D?"
- "What are Incompact3D's dependencies?"

### Repository Management Queries
- "What repositories are currently configured?"
- "Add my organization's package repository"
- "Which repository has the highest priority?"
- "Remove the outdated experimental repository"

### Resource Planning Queries
- "What resources are available on this cluster?"
- "What are the hardware specifications?"
- "Is the resource graph built?"
- "What are the deployment constraints?"

## MCP Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Workflow-First Design
Tools solve complete user problems rather than exposing individual CLI commands.

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation

- Prerequisites and failure scenarios
- Related tools and workflow guidance
- Usage examples and common patterns
- Decision-making logic and recommendations

### 3. Intelligent Decision Support
Tools provide guidance and recommendations:
- Package selection guidance by type
- Common package combinations
- Quick-start recommendations
- Resource optimization suggestions

### 4. Structured Output
Type-safe Pydantic models ensure consistent, actionable responses.

### 5. Context Awareness
Tools understand their role in larger workflows and provide appropriate guidance.

### 6. Error Handling Excellence
Comprehensive error handling with specific resolution guidance.
