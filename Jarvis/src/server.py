Jarvis MCP Server - Phase 1: Discoverability Implementation

This server implements the first phase of the Jarvis MCP according to the design document,
focusing on discoverability tools that enable users to explore and understand the Jarvis
ecosystem - available packages, repositories, capabilities, and system resources.

Following MCP best practices, these tools are designed with a workflow-first approach
rather than direct API mapping, providing intelligent, contextual assistance for
HPC workflow planning and deployment.

Use this to explore what packages are available before creating pipelines or to understand the 
full ecosystem of tools at your disposal.

**Discovery Strategy**:
1. Scans all registered repositories in priority order
2. Categorizes packages by type and use case  
3. Provides relevance scoring based on common usage patterns
4. Highlights packages with strong documentation and examples
5. Identifies package relationships and common combinations

**Selection Guidance**:
- **Services**: Long-running systems (storage, databases, web servers)
- **Applications**: Finite-execution programs (benchmarks, simulations)  
- **Interceptors**: Monitoring and profiling tools (tracers, debuggers)

**Common Package Combinations**:
- Storage + Benchmark: "orangefs" + "ior" for filesystem testing
- Simulation + Analysis: "incompact3d" + "paraview" for flow visualization
- Development + Debug: "hermes" + "hermes_api" for I/O optimization

Use this to understand your repository configuration, troubleshoot repository issues, or get

**Repository Priority System**:
Jarvis searches repositories in priority order (1 = highest priority). When multiple repositories 
contain packages with the same name, higher priority repositories take precedence. This system 
allows custom implementations to override built-in packages while maintaining fallback options.

**Repository Types**:
- **Built-in**: Official Jarvis repository with core packages
- **Custom**: Organization-specific repositories with local packages
- **Development**: Local development repositories for testing
- **Cached**: Local copies of remote repositories for offline use

**Health Status Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Active: Repository accessible and functioning normally
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Minor issues (slow response, outdated packages)
- ‚ùå Error: Major issues (inaccessible, corrupted, permission denied)

**Repository Management Operations**:

**ADD**: Register new repository with comprehensive validation
- Validates repository structure and package compatibility
- Checks for naming conflicts with existing repositories
- Verifies accessibility and permission requirements
- Adds to end of priority list (lowest priority initially)
- Creates backup of configuration before changes

**DELETE**: Safely remove repository with dependency checking  
- Analyzes active pipelines for dependencies on repository packages
- Provides impact analysis before removal
- Offers migration suggestions for affected pipelines
- Removes from search path without deleting repository files
- Creates rollback instructions for recovery

**PROMOTE**: Elevate repository to highest priority with conflict resolution
- Moves repository to top of search priority list
- Analyzes package conflicts that may result from priority change
- Provides warnings about packages that will be shadowed
- Updates configuration atomically to prevent inconsistent state
