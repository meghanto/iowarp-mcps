## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Linux/macOS environment (for optimal compatibility)
- SSH client (for remote node capabilities)

## Setup

### 1. Navigate to Node Hardware Directory
```bash
cd /path/to/scientific-mcps/Node_Hardware
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Using UV (recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

Using pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Run the MCP Server directly:**

   ```bash
   uv run node-hardware-mcp
   ```
   
   This will create a `.venv/` folder, install all required packages, and run the server directly.


## Running the Server with Different Types of Clients:

### Running the Server with the WARP Client
To interact with the Node Hardware MCP server, use the main `wrp.py` client. You will need to configure it to point to the Node Hardware server.

1.  **Configure:** Ensure that `Node_Hardware` is listed in the `MCP` section of your chosen configuration file (e.g., in `bin/confs/Gemini.yaml` or `bin/confs/Ollama.yaml`).
    ```yaml
    # In bin/confs/Gemini.yaml
    MCP:
      - Node_Hardware
      # - Adios
      # - HDF5
    ```

2.  **Run:** Start the client from the repository root with your desired configuration:
    ```bash
    # Example using the Gemini configuration 
    python3 bin/wrp.py --conf=bin/confs/Gemini.yaml
    ```

### Running the Server with Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop `settings.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pandas-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/scientific-mcps/sNode_Hardware",
        "run", 
        "node-hardware-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Claude CLI Integration**
```bash
claude add mcp node-hardware -- uv --directory ~/path/to/scientific-mcps/Node_Hardware run node-hardware-mcp
```

    components=['cpu', 'memory'],
    include_performance=True
)

# System health assessment
health_check()
```

### SSH Configuration

For remote node capabilities, ensure:

1. **SSH Access**: Target hosts must have SSH service running
2. **Authentication**: Either password or SSH key authentication
3. **Python**: Target hosts should have Python 3.6+ installed
4. **Permissions**: User must have appropriate permissions for system information

### Common SSH Key Setup

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy public key to remote host
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@hostname

# Test SSH connection
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@hostname
```

## Available Component Filters

When using `get_node_info` or `get_remote_node_info`, you can filter components:

### Available Components:
- `cpu` - CPU specifications and usage with performance optimization
- `memory` - Memory usage and specifications with efficiency analysis
- `disk` - Disk usage and storage information with health monitoring
- `network` - Network interfaces and statistics with security analysis
- `system` - System information (OS, uptime, users) with configuration analysis
- `processes` - Running processes and resource usage with optimization insights
- `gpu` - GPU information with thermal and performance analysis (if available)
- `sensors` - Temperature and sensor data with predictive maintenance
- `performance` - Real-time performance monitoring with bottleneck analysis
- `summary` - Integrated hardware overview with cross-subsystem analysis

### Filter Examples:
- `components=['cpu', 'memory']` - Focus on processor and memory analysis
- `exclude_components=['processes', 'sensors']` - Skip resource-intensive collections
- `components=['system', 'summary']` - Basic system overview with intelligence
- `components=['cpu', 'memory', 'gpu']` - High-performance computing analysis
- `components=['performance']` - Real-time performance monitoring only
- `exclude_components=['processes']` - Faster collection without process details


### Running the Server Standalone
For testing and development:

```bash
# Start the server
uv run node-hardware-mcp

# Or run directly
python -m node_hardware.server
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

The server provides comprehensive error handling with:

- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear descriptions of what went wrong
- **Error Classifications**: Categorized error types for better understanding
- **Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations for resolving issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results when some components fail
- **Intelligent Troubleshooting**: Context-aware troubleshooting guidance

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **SSH Connection Failures**:
   - Check network connectivity and firewall settings
   - Verify SSH service is running on target host
   - Confirm authentication credentials and permissions
   - Test SSH connection manually with verbose output
   - Check SSH key permissions (600 for private keys)

2. **Permission Errors**:
   - Run with appropriate user privileges for system access
   - Check file system permissions for configuration files
   - Verify SSH key permissions and ownership
   - Ensure user has hardware monitoring permissions

3. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Install required system utilities (lm-sensors, nvidia-smi, etc.)
   - Ensure Python libraries are available and up-to-date
   - Check for platform-specific requirements and compatibility
   - Verify system monitoring capabilities are enabled

4. **Performance Issues**:
   - Use component filtering to reduce data collection overhead
   - Optimize SSH connection parameters for network conditions
   - Consider local caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor system resources during collection

## Performance Considerations

- **Local Operations**: Typically complete in under 1 second with intelligent caching
- **Remote Operations**: Depend on network latency and SSH connection time (optimized for efficiency)
- **Component Filtering**: Significantly reduces data collection time and network usage
- **Intelligent Caching**: Smart caching for frequently accessed information
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimized data collection with concurrent operations
- **Two-Tool Efficiency**: Specialized tools for local vs remote operations optimize performance

## Security Notes

- **SSH Connections**: Use key-based authentication when possible for enhanced security
- **Credentials**: Never store passwords in configuration files or version control
- **Network**: Ensure secure network connections for remote operations
- **Permissions**: Run with minimal required privileges following security best practices
- **Monitoring**: Built-in security monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities
