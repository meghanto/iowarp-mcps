## Available Actions


#### `compress_file`
Compress a file using gzip compression.

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Use compress_file function
result = compress_file()
print(result)
```


## Integration Examples


### Utility Operations
```python
# Use Compression utilities
result = perform_operation("input_data")
optimized = optimize_result(result)

# Chain operations
processed = process_data(input_data)
final_result = finalize_processing(processed)
```

### Automation Workflow
```python
# Automate repetitive tasks
for item in input_list:
    processed = process_item(item)
    validate_result(processed)
    store_result(processed)
```
