## Integration Examples


### Data Processing Workflow
```python
# Load and process data with Plot MCP
data = load_data("input_file")
processed = process_data(data)

# Integrate with other MCPs
visualization = create_plot(processed, "chart_type")
save_results(processed, "output_file")
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple files
files = list_files("data_directory")
for file in files:
    data = load_data(file)
    result = process_data(data)
    save_processed(result, f"processed_{file}")
```
