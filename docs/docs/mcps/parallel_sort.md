## Advanced Features


### Advanced Analytics
Comprehensive analysis and visualization capabilities:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Built-in statistical functions
- **Visualization**: Create charts, plots, and visual representations
- **Interactive**: Generate interactive visualizations

### Customizable Output
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for various output formats
- **Styling Options**: Customizable appearance and themes
- **Export Ready**: Easy export for reports and presentations


## Available Actions


#### `sort_log_by_timestamp`
Sort log file lines by timestamps in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. Handles edge cases like empty files and invalid timestamps.

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Use sort_log_by_timestamp function
result = sort_log_by_timestamp()
print(result)
```


#### `parallel_sort_large_file`
Sort large log files using parallel processing with chunked approach for improved performance.

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Use parallel_sort_large_file function
result = parallel_sort_large_file()
print(result)
```


#### `analyze_log_statistics`
Generate comprehensive statistics and analysis for log files including temporal patterns, log levels, and quality metrics.

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Use analyze_log_statistics function
result = analyze_log_statistics()
print(result)
```


#### `detect_log_patterns`
Detect patterns in log files including anomalies, error clusters, trending issues, and repeated patterns.

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Use detect_log_patterns function
result = detect_log_patterns()
print(result)
```


#### `filter_logs`
Filter log entries based on multiple conditions with support for complex logical operations.

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Use filter_logs function
result = filter_logs()
print(result)
```


#### Additional Actions
This MCP provides 8 additional actions. Refer to the MCP server documentation for complete details.


## Integration Examples


### Data Analysis Pipeline
```python
# Analyze data with Parallel-Sort MCP
data = load_csv("experiment_data.csv")
analysis = analyze_data(data)

# Create visualizations
plot = create_visualization(analysis, "plot_type")
save_plot(plot, "analysis_results.png")
```

### Interactive Analysis
```python
# Interactive data exploration
summary = get_data_summary(data)
correlations = calculate_correlations(data)
create_dashboard(summary, correlations)
```
