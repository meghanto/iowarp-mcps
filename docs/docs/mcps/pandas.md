### 1. Data Loading and Profiling
```
I have a large CSV file with sales data that I need to load and get a comprehensive profile including data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
```

**Tools called:**
- `load_data` - Load CSV file with intelligent format detection
- `profile_data` - Get comprehensive data profile and quality metrics
- `statistical_summary` - Generate descriptive statistics and distributions

### 2. Data Cleaning and Quality Assessment
```
My dataset has missing values and outliers that need to be handled. I also want to remove duplicates and validate the data quality.
```

**Tools called:**
- `handle_missing_data` - Impute missing values with appropriate strategies
- `clean_data` - Remove outliers, duplicates, and optimize data types
- `validate_data` - Apply business rules and data quality checks

### 3. Statistical Analysis and Correlation
```
Analyze the relationships between different variables in my dataset and perform hypothesis testing to validate my assumptions.
```

**Tools called:**
- `correlation_analysis` - Calculate correlation matrices with different methods
- `hypothesis_testing` - Perform t-tests, ANOVA, and normality tests
- `statistical_summary` - Generate comprehensive statistical insights

### 4. Data Transformation and Aggregation
```
I need to group my sales data by region and product category, then create pivot tables for cross-analysis and merge with customer data.
```

**Tools called:**
- `groupby_operations` - Group data and perform multiple aggregations
- `pivot_table` - Create pivot tables with multi-level indexing
- `merge_datasets` - Join datasets using different merge strategies

### 5. Time Series Analysis and Filtering
```
Analyze my time series data by resampling to different frequencies, calculating rolling averages, and filtering specific date ranges.
```

**Tools called:**
- `time_series_operations` - Resample, rolling windows, and lag features
- `filter_data` - Apply complex time-based filtering conditions
- `statistical_summary` - Analyze time series patterns and trends

### 6. Data Export and Memory Optimization
```
Optimize memory usage of my large dataset and export the cleaned data to multiple formats for different teams.
```

**Tools called:**
- `optimize_memory` - Reduce memory usage with dtype optimization
- `save_data` - Export to CSV, Excel, Parquet, and JSON formats
- `profile_data` - Verify optimization results and final data quality
