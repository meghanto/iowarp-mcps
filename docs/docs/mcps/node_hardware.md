<summary><b>Install in Cursor</b></summary>

Go to: `Settings` -> `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "node-hardware-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["iowarp-mcps", "node-hardware"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Install in VS Code</b></summary>
